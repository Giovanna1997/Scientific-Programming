•	Creation, manipulation, and operations
•	Practical examples with code snippets

2. Data.ipynb
Focused on working with data, this notebook includes:
•	Importing necessary packages
•	Understanding and plotting the standard normal distribution
•	Using the Distributions package for creating and analyzing distributions
•	Comparing samples using statistical tests
•	Visualizing data with Plotly

3. Functions.ipynb
A comprehensive guide to creating and using functions. Topics include:
•	Single and multiple expression functions
•	Flow control within functions
•	Optional and keyword arguments
•	Handling variable numbers of arguments
